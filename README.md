# Production Analysis using IOT

## Problem Statment:
<p align="justify">
We often see that the production of an certain product we cant see the producton on the real time of the producton we see the past records and the the record which are updated after an interval of time so to rectify this problem we are connecting an arudiono to our machine and wrote an code to rectify this problem and give an output of on time, off time, ideal time of the machine

## Tools Used:
- Wokwi
- Arudino UNO
- Led
- Switch
- Wires

## Solution :
<p align="justify">
Through an Arduino-based configuration, this project makes use of an Internet of Things-enabled system to track and evaluate machine operation.  A button that functions as an on/off switch and an LED that indicates the machine's operating status are combined to track the machine's running, turned-off, and idle states.  To determine production output, the system records the length of time spent in each state, particularly the "running" stage.  We can examine efficiency and pinpoint areas for improvement by comparing production data with the machine's uptime.  Additionally, the Arduino produces data that may be examined further to have a better understanding of machine optimization and performance.
