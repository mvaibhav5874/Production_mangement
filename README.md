# Production Analysis using IOT

## Problem Statment:
We often see that the production of an certain product we cant see the producton on the real time of the producton we see the past records and the the record which are updated after an interval of time so to rectify this problem we are connecting an arudiono to our machine and wrote an code to rectify this problem and give an output of on time, off time, ideal time of the machine   

## Tools Used:
- Wokwi
- Arudino UNO
- Led
- Switch
- Wires

## Solution :
we are using the IOT to this project by connecting the arudiono to an led and button in which the led refers to the working of the machine and the button refers to the switch which is used to turn on/off the machine.and written an code which works on the state of the machine running,Turned-off,ideal and the amount of time the machine on is on those states and by the amount of time that is on we analize the production of the items that were produced on that time were anilized and if we need we could also analize the data which is produced on the arudino
